# Real-Time Audio Summary System Development Plan

## Technology Stack Recommendation

**Framework Choice: Tauri**
- Significantly smaller bundle size (8MB vs 207MB for Electron)[10]
- Lower memory and CPU usage[9][10]
- Better performance overall, which will be crucial when running LLMs locally[10]

**Backend: Rust**
- Near-C speeds with zero-cost abstractions and compile-time optimizations[6]
- Excellent for real-time audio processing applications[14]
- Superior memory management through its ownership model[6]
- Safe and efficient parallel programming capabilities[6]

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript with React or Vue

**LLM Integration:** Local, open-source models via Rust libraries

## Core System Components

### 1. Audio Capture Module

**Windows Implementation:**
- Implement using win-capture-audio approach to directly capture audio from specific applications[12]
- Use Windows Audio Session API (WASAPI) through Rust bindings

**Mac Implementation:**
- For macOS 13 (Ventura) and higher: Use macOS Audio Capture Source to capture specific application audio[19]
- Alternative options: Audio Hijack or Loopback by Rogue Amoeba for per-application audio capture[19][22]

### 2. Transcription Engine

- Implement real-time speech-to-text processing using Whisper model (open-source)
- Process audio in chunks for continuous transcription
- Create a buffer system to manage audio segments

### 3. LLM Summarization Engine

**Recommended Models:**
- LLaMA 2 - recognized as one of the best open-source LLMs for summarization[3]
- Phi3-Mini - excellent performance for text summarization with smaller resource footprint[4]
- Llama3.2-3B-Ins - achieves results comparable to 70B LLMs while being much more efficient[4]

**Integration:**
- Use the Kalosm crate for Rust, which provides simple APIs for loading and using LLMs locally[8]
- Implement chunking mechanisms to handle continuous transcription input
- Create optimized prompts for real-time summarization

### 4. Storage System

- Use SQLite with Rusqlite bindings for local data storage
- Create schema for audio metadata, transcripts, and summaries
- Implement CRUD operations for managing saved summaries

### 5. User Interface

- Design an intuitive interface with:
  - Application selector for audio source
  - Real-time transcription display
  - Live summary view with editing capabilities
  - Archive of past summaries with search functionality

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Setup & Audio Capture (3-4 weeks)
- Set up Tauri project structure with Rust backend
- Implement platform-specific audio capture modules
- Create basic UI framework
- Establish cross-platform testing environment

### Phase 2: Transcription Pipeline (2-3 weeks)
- Integrate Whisper model for speech recognition
- Implement real-time audio processing
- Display live transcription in the UI
- Test transcription accuracy and latency

### Phase 3: LLM Integration (3-4 weeks)
- Implement local LLM loading and initialization
- Create summarization pipeline with prompt engineering
- Handle continuous text processing for real-time summaries
- Optimize LLM performance for resource constraints

### Phase 4: Storage & User Features (2-3 weeks)
- Implement database schema and storage logic
- Create summary management interface (edit, delete, organize)
- Add user preferences for model selection and behavior
- Implement export functionality for summaries

### Phase 5: Optimization & Refinement (2-3 weeks)
- Optimize performance across both platforms
- Reduce memory usage and increase responsiveness
- Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Polish UI/UX based on testing feedback

## Technical Implementation Details

### Audio Capture Implementation

```rust
// Example Rust code for audio capture abstraction
trait AudioCapture {
    fn start_capture(&self, application_id: &str) -> Result;
    fn stop_capture(&self) -> Result;
    fn get_audio_chunk(&self) -> Result;
}

struct WindowsAudioCapture {
    // Windows-specific implementation
}

struct MacOSAudioCapture {
    // macOS-specific implementation
}
```

### LLM Integration

```rust
// Example of using Kalosm for LLM integration in Rust
use kalosm::llama;

fn initialize_llm() -> Result {
    // Load a 4-bit quantized Llama 3.1 model
    let model = llama::Llama::new()?
        .with_chat()
        .default_model()
        .load()?;
    Ok(model)
}

fn generate_summary(model: &Model, transcript: &str) -> Result {
    let prompt = format!(
        "Summarize the following meeting transcript concisely: {}",
        transcript
    );
    
    let response = model.generate(&prompt)?;
    Ok(response)
}
```

## Deployment Strategy

- Use Tauri's built-in packaging system for creating native installers
- Implement first-run setup for downloading appropriate LLM models
- Store models and data in platform-appropriate locations
- Create automatic update mechanism

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge 1: Cross-platform audio capture inconsistencies**
- Solution: Create robust abstraction layers with graceful fallbacks

**Challenge 2: LLM performance on lower-end machines**
- Solution: Offer model size options (from under 1B to 3B parameters) based on available resources[4]

**Challenge 3: Real-time processing latency**
- Solution: Implement incremental processing and use worker threads for LLM operations

## Future Enhancements

- Speaker diarization for multi-person meetings
- Topic extraction and categorization
- Integration with calendar systems for automatic meeting context
- Collaborative features for team usage
- Cloud sync options with end-to-end encryption

This development plan provides a comprehensive approach to building a performant, cross-platform audio summarization system using Tauri and Rust. The combination of efficient audio capture, local LLM processing, and intuitive user interface will enable users to effectively capture and summarize audio from applications while maintaining privacy and performance.
